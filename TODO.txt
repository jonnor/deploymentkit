== 0.1.0 release ==
Criteria:
    Can build simple package recipes for common GNU/Linux targets
        Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE/ArchLinux
    Name has been decided?

Core

* Add deployment options
Let dk-generate and associated take an _optional_ YAML file with the
deployment options. This file gives the target specific configuration detailing how
how to create a given build recipe. This allows the package recipe to be
completely free of target-dependent configuration
Acts as overrides to the default/system configuration

Example uses:
- Overriding how a dependency should be resolved
For instance for bundling, or static dep resolvement for testing
- Which toolchain should be used, and any options for that toolchain
- Any special configure/build options for the given target

Format:
- list of entries matching against targets
- The options for this entry then applies to the given targets.
- Matching should allow wildcards

* Add Provides attribute to the package recipe
Lists which identifiers this package provides. Provides: ['pkgconfig:gegl-0.1', 'executable:gegl']
This allows DeploymentKit to automatically find dependencies for bundling
by looking in the current directory for recipes which provides the dependency
wanted.

Testing
 * Set/hook up OBS/Launchpad/native builders to run the example builds

Backends
* New target support
 * Fedora
 * Ubuntu & Debian
 
* Generic dependency resolving
It should be possible to resolve dependencies for all targets on any host
system. Otherwise developers will not be able to generate the build recipes
on their own systems and be able to send them to a package builder service
for building.
This will require the package/repositories metadata of GNU/Linux systems
to be available for download, and that this can be used by DeploymentKit

== 0.2.0 ==

Core
* Support for packages bundling for GNU/Linux targets
Also needs to support "optification", using /opt/application-name as the system prefix 
Also generate a wrapper shell script for setting up up LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc,
and .desktop file using this script to start the application
* Support multiple targets in combination with OBS
Requires single .spec file with if clauses for target variations,
and slightly different names for the debian packaging + a .dsc file

Backends
* Mobile Linux support: Maemo5 Fremantle, MeeGo Harmattan

== 0.3.0 ==

Backends
 * Windows mingw32 (MSI/NSIS)
 * Mac OSX (macports/fink/dmg/app bundle)

== Later ==

Backends
* Post/Pre Install/Uninstall script support
This might need to come earlier, due to it being commonly required
for even simple applications. Typical usecase include:
- updating mimetype handling database
- registration of gsettings/gconf schema files
Application developers should be able to _declare_ that they have
certain features (GConfSchemas: ['app.schemas, additional.schemas']), and DeploymentKit will figure out what is necessary
to make it work correctly on the different targets
 

* New target support
 * RHEL/CentOS
 * Mandriva
 * Gentoo
 * Embedded Linux: openWRT, Yocto
 * other GNU/Linux...

 * BSDs et.c.

== Maybe ==

* Multiple sub (binary) packages
This feature would be wanted by distribution packagers, but is typically
not that important to application developers.  Out-of-scope unless
strong arguments pro it comes up for the primary target personas.

== In related projects ==
PackageKit:
    * Method of querying package for executables
    * Method of querying package for pkg-config identifiers

Open Build Service:
    * Arch Linux support (2011 OpenSUSE GSOC)
    * Support for running DeploymentKit
    to generate the target recipes
