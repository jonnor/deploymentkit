= Design =
- A target-independent package recipe is converted by DeploymentKit
into the required specific package recipe for a given target.

The specific package recipie is then used together with a native,
or cross-platform/cross-build toolchain to build the files the user will install.
This allows software developers to deploy for a number of platforms
without having to know and go through the details of deploying for each and every one.

- The package recipe format is declarative, using a standardized, machine-parsable format

The declarative nature of the package recipe enables it to be manipulated
programatically. For example it can be generated by the build system used,
or it can be integrated into IDE's and other graphical tools.

= Development principles =
- Enable and encourage others to contribute
- Contribute changes to related projects where appropriate,
instead of working around the problems
- Reuse as much as possible of existing code and projects
- Use real, non-trivial software projects as test subjects
- Automated testing of all supported features on supported target platforms
- Dogfooding, use in own projects
- Focus first on simple but high-impact use-cases
- Documentation lives as close to the relevant code as possible
